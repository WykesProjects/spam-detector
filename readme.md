# Email Spam Detection (MSc Project)

This project uses the UCI Spambase dataset and the Scikit-learn library to classify emails as spam or not spam. It forms part of my MSc Computer Science coursework and explores a real-world classification task, performance evaluation, and ethical implications of machine learning in communication systems.

## 📊 Dataset
- UCI ML Repository: [Spambase](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase)

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Model Used
- RandomForestClassifier

## ✅ Performance Metrics
- Accuracy: ...
- Precision: ...
- Recall: ...
- F1 Score: ...

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- Potential bias in what is considered "spam"
- Risk of false positives (misclassifying important emails)
- Dataset privacy handling
